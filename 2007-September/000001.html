A more accurate judge of activity would be the commit logs or the
discussions in #vg4nbsd. The list is not used actively to discuss
development issues as we use the chat channel for that purpose. There
is no reason to this, its just turned out that way.

</I>The most difficult aspect is definitely time. None of us doing the
port actively have a fulltime job where we can work on this. We have
to find one two hours on the weekdays/weekends to do work on the port.
The nature of the project also means that the work is very high
effort/low yield.  Doing sustained development is also hard as there
are many unknowns to the porting effort. Technically there have been
many challenges as well, but none harder than the human factors. In
fact the most work we ever got done was when me eric and peter had a
chance to meet for 3 days and hack at it. Time difference also make it
harder for us to do 'hackathons' ( 8 hours difference between me and
peter).

Do drop by freenode #vg4nbsd and we can discuss in depth on the
technical issues.

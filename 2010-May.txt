Subject: [Vg4nbsd-devel] Porting Valgrind to SH4

Hello all.

I'm currently developing for Linux on SH4.
Unfortunately, Valgrind doesn't exist for that platform.
As this tool is awesome, I'm considering porting it on Linux/SH4

Would it be or not a too huge work to do such a thing ?
Do you think it can be possible in about 5 months, at least for the basics ?

I'm asking this to you because even if you are porting Valgrind for another OS and not another platform, so maybe you have some clues about that.


Thanks.
Regards.

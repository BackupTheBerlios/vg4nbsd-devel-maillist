Hey there,

I stumbled across this project a couple months ago and I'm really interested
in trying to do some work on this.  I was wondering if anybody had some
comments to share about what the state of the project currently is and what
needs to happen next.

I've been on the IRC channel a couple times, and I'll continue to hang out
there when I can.

thanks,
Geoff

Hi Geoff,

Unfortunately the project has stagnated for quite a while and we ( Myself,
Eric and Peter) are no longer working on it.
Currently its at a state where it can run and debug simple programs, but is
based on an old release of valgrind.

To revive the project, the best approach would be to start from scratch
again on the latest Valgrind source code and port up the changes that are
needed. The major mistake we made was that we forked valgrind, instead of
making our changes a patch set. We then lost momentum when we realised that
we need to invest a lot of time in fixing this in order for our changes to
track the development branch of valgrind.

Furthermore, the project was focused on NetBSD 3, while we are now at 5. I
suspect that the syscalls master list would have changed a fair bit by now.

However, we should also be able to leverage the code in the mainline for
Darwin/x86. One of our biggest changes was to handle syscalls with arguments
passed by stack instead of by register ( in linux), the Darwin port will
probably have these changes in already.

Most of the work was done within 'coregrind'. Vex (the x86-to-x86
translator) was largely untouched. The 'skins' or 'tools' such as nullgrind,
cachegrind and so on also had minimal changes.

If you would like to revive the project, I'd be happy to do what I can to
help you get started, but I think that it may be tough to get the original
(Me, Eric and Peter) back together for the project.

Thanks,
Kailash
